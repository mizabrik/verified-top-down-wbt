@inproceedings{fta,
	abstract = {In the FTA project in Nijmegen we have formalised a constructive proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. In the formalisation, we have first defined the (constructive) algebraic hierarchy of groups, rings, fields, etcetera. For the reals we have then defined the notion of real number structure, which is basically a Cauchy complete Archimedean ordered field. This boils down to axiomatising the constructive reals. The proof of FTA is then given from these axioms (so independent of a specific construction of the reals), where the complex numbers are defined as pairs of real numbers.},
